*-------------------------->ABSTRACT CLASS IN DART<-----------------------------

*DEFINITION OF ABSTRACT CLASS : 
*----------------------------
"
Abstract classes are classes that cannot be initialized. It is used to define the
behavior of a class that can be inherited by other classes. An abstract class is
declared using the keyword abstract.

"
*SYNTEX:
*-------
abstract class className{
  any properties ==> like that are common of inherting classes

  methods();
  methods2();

}

*NOTE:
*-----
The abstract class is used to define the behavior of a class that can be 
inherited by other classes. You can define an abstract method inside an abstract class.
A abstarct class cannot an initialize directly

*Key Points To Remember:
*----------------------
*You canâ€™t create an object of an abstract class.
*It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
*It is used to define the behavior of a class that other classes can inherit.
*Abstract method only has a signature and no implementation.
