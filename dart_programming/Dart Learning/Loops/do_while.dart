/*
------------------------------------->Do-While Loops <--------------------------
Do while loop is used to run a block of code multiple times. The loopâ€™s body will 
be executed first, and then the condition is tested. The syntax of do while loop :

do{
    statement1;
    statement2;
    .
    .
    .
    statementN;
}while(condition);



1....First, it runs statements, and finally, the condition is checked.
2....If the condition is true, the code inside {} is executed.
3....The condition is re-checked until the condition is false.
4....When the condition is false, the loop stops.
